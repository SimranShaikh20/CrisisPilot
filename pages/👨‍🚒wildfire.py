# Title and Introduction
st.title("Early Wildfire Detection SystemðŸ”¥")
st.markdown("""
Wildfires pose significant threats to ecosystems, property, and lives. 
Our solution leverages satellite imagery, particularly data from **NOAA-20 satellites (VIIRS)**, 
to detect wildfires at their earliest stages, enabling faster and more effective disaster response planning.

# How It Works Section
st.subheader("How Does It Work?")
st.markdown("""
The system uses advanced **Deep Learning models (CNN)** to analyze satellite images. 
By identifying subtle changes in vegetation density and landscape patterns, 
the model can detect potential wildfire hotspots with remarkable precision.
