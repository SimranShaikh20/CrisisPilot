## Inspiration
Natural disasters strike without warning, leaving communities vulnerable and emergency responders racing against time. We were deeply moved by recent catastrophic events where delayed response times led to preventable losses. This inspired us to leverage cutting-edge AI technology to revolutionize disaster management and potentially save countless lives.

## What it does
Sahayta.ai is a comprehensive disaster management solution that combines multiple AI-powered systems:

### 1. Early-Stage Wildfire Detection 
- Analyzes NOAA-20 VIIRS satellite imagery in real-time
- Achieves 90.5% accuracy using transfer-learned RESNET101
- Provides immediate alerts to emergency response teams

### 2. Drone-Based Victim Detection 
- Implements YOLOv8 for real-time human detection
- Enables swift aerial search and rescue operations
- Processes high-resolution imagery for accurate victim localization

### 3. AI-Powered Flood Analysis 
- Performs semantic segmentation using U-NET architecture
- Maps flood-affected areas for resource optimization
- Generates actionable insights for emergency responders

### 4. Integrated Emergency Response System 
- Monitors real-time weather conditions
- Identifies high-risk zones through geolocation
- Includes animal welfare protection features
- Predicts risk levels using weather-location correlation

## How we built it

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing 
- Gathered satellite imagery from NOAA-20 VIIRS
